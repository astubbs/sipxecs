Notes on managing a sipX "interop server".

* DNS configuration

The SIPXCHANGE_DOMAIN_NAME name should have an ordinary DNS A record.

To support the "DNS SRV Record Processing" test, the INTEROP_ALIAS_UDP
and INTEROP_ALIAS_TCP names should have DNS SRV records like these:

_sip._tcp.{INTEROP_ALIAS_TCP}. IN SRV	1 1 5060 {SIPXCHANGE_DOMAIN_NAME}.
_sip._udp.{INTEROP_ALIAS_UDP}. IN SRV	1 1 5060 {SIPXCHANGE_DOMAIN_NAME}.

* To update the sipX code:

From a machine inside Pingtel, create a directory and download the
RPMs for the desired version.  E.g.:

	wget --no-parent -r -nd \
		http://falcon.pingtel.com/ecs/main/FC/6/010020/RPM

Create a destination directory on interop (e.g., ~/8551) and upload
the RPMs to it:

	scp *.rpm interop:8551

On interop, stop sipX and install the new PRMs:

	sudo /sbin/service sipxpbx stop

	sudo rpm --upgrade -p *.rpm

Note that rpm will attempt to install any RPMs that have the *same*
version as the currently installed version, as well as any that are
*newer*.  The former will fail (which causes the entire rpm command to
fail), so you have to inspect the output of rpm for messages like
this:

	package xerces-c-2.7.0-3 is already installed
	package ruby-gems-0.8.11-2 is already installed
	package cgicc-3.2.3-2 is already installed

Rename these RPMs to have a different extension (or delete them), and
run the rpm command again.

Do not install the sipXconfig RPMs (sipxconfig, sipxconfig-agent,
sipxconfig-ftp, sipxconfig-report, and sipxconfig-tftp), as the
interop configuration uses special config files.  Also, do not install
the Call Resolver (sipxproxy-cdr), as that requires Postgres to be set
up.

Once the RPMs are installed, restart sipX:

	sudo /sbin/service sipxpbx start

* To update the Interop sipX configuration:

Create an updated working copy of the configuration files:

	svn co -q https://sipxecs.sipfoundry.org/rep/sipXecs/main/extras/interop-server-config

Generate the config.defs file:

	cd ./interop.pingtel.com
	touch sipx_confdir/config.defs.in
	sudo make /etc/sipxpbx/config.defs

Edit /etc/sipxpbx/config.defs for any needed customization.

Generate the remainder of the configuration files:

	sudo make install

Restart sipX:

	sudo /sbin/service sipxpbx restart
