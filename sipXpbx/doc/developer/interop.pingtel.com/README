This directory contains the configuration for the interoperability test server,
interop.pingtel.com.

The subdirectories are:

sipx_confdir
   Configuration files to be unpacked into /etc/sipxpbx after a standard
   sipX installation.

scripts
   Scripts that are run as cron jobs, and the crontab file that run them.

The current number assignments are as follows.  "gg" is the group
number, from 00 to 99.  (index.html claims only 10..99 as groups, but
we may need the single-digit groups as well.)  "1/9" means 1 through
9, to shorten the table.
