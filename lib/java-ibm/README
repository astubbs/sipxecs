We use PKCS key sizes in our application that default IBM's JRE 
restricts.  You need to also install unrestrict142.zip otherwise
sipxconfig will not start up properly. See
  http://track.sipfoundry.org/browse/XCF-938

if you are switch from Sun's JRE you will not see this error unless
you install new ssl keys.
